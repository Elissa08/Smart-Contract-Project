# Smart-Contract-Project

This program is for creating a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Description

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language that operates smart contracts. These contracts oversee the conduct of Ethereum state accounts. The contract includes a feature that generates and terminates the token value of the contract. This software functions as an uncomplicated introduction to Solidity programming and can serve as a foundation for more intricate undertakings later on.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., project.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity 0.8.13;












To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.13" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile project.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "project" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract has been deployed, you can interact with it through various functions such as require(), assert() and revert() statements.
